# Dependency directories
# Why: We don't want to copy your local node_modules because they may be 
# built for your OS (Mac/Windows), whereas the container needs Linux versions.

# Next.js build output
# Why: We want the Dockerfile to run a fresh 'npm run build' inside the 
# container to ensure the build is clean and matches the container environment.

# Debug and Log files
# Why: These are temporary files created during errors and don't belong 
# in a production image.

# Environment and Secrets
# Why: Never include secret keys or local environment configurations 
# in a Docker image for security reasons.

# Version Control
# Why: The container doesn't need your entire Git history to run the app.

# Testing and Coverage
# Why: Cypress and coverage reports are for development and testing, 
# not for the final running website.
